        "description":"<p>Join us for three days in April at the Market Street Prototyping Festival when Market Street will come alive as a public platform to test over 50 innovative ideas to improve San Francisco’s civic spine. Nature in the City is pleased to provide nature-based programming with <i>Market Street as Habitat </i>in conjunction with the Studio for Urban Projects <b>Outpost </b>prototype. </p> <p>Now, let’s take a cue from the butterfly! It’s remarkable, really, how the Western Tiger Swallowtail has found a home on San Francisco’s Market Street. And it’s not alone. Come participate in a festival of events—from citizen science bioblitzing, to mothing on Market Street, to planting workshops, wildlife tours, and outdoor play—to inspire you to discover the wilder side of Market Street. Also you’re in for a very special treat! We have just published a field guide to Market Street, and copies will be available for the first time here! </p> <p>Though it may seem that Market Street is devoid of wild creatures, the Western Tiger Swallowtail soars in abundance high in the canopy of the London Plane trees where they lay their eggs. What’s missing for this butterfly, however, are flowering plants to sustain their adult flight. So in our planting workshop, we’ll provide critical nectar sources for us to plant together! After all, Market Street is a habitat for us all. </p> <p><b>Event Schedule</b>: </p> <p><i><b>Market Street as Habitat</b></i> at the <i><b>Outpost </b></i>April 9-11, 2015 (Prototype located on the north side of Market Street between 6th and 7th)</p> <p><b><i>Market Street as Habitat</i> </b>program: </p> <p>Thursday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Resident naturalist Peter Brastow on local biodiversity</p> <p>Thursday, 9 p.m. Resident naturalist Ken-ichi Ueda at the moth light</p> <p>Friday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Resident naturalists Sarah McConnico and Amber Hasselbring nectar planting workshop</p> <p>Saturday, 7 a.m. Resident naturalist for a morning bird walk</p> <p>Saturday, 10 a.m. Nerds on Safari Bioblitz with Nerds for Nature, iNaturalist, California Academy of Sciences, and you</p> <p>Saturday, 1 p.m. Catalog and share our Bioblitz sightings</p> <p>Saturday, 5 p.m. Resident Naturalist Amber Hasselbring <i><b>Tigers on Market Street</b></i> naturalist talk</p> <p><b>More info</b>: </p> <p>Nerds on Safari Bioblitz information here:</p>",

        "description":"<p>Join us in San Francisco's downtown during the Market Street Prototyping Festival, for a grassroots, smartphone-powered bioblitz to catalogue every living species we can identify from from the Embarcadero to Civic Center and all parks and plazas in between!</p> <p>We will be blitzing from the wee hours until after dark. Meet us at 10:00 AM for the public portion of the bioblitz.</p> <p><br/><b>The public bioblitz:</b></p> <p>Meet at Sidewalk Prototype in front of The Hall at 1028 Market Street, San Francisco, at <b>10 AM sharp</b> to begin the daytime portion of the blitz. Meet again at <b>1 PM sharp</b> to share our discoveries. </p> <p>Bring your smartphone and/or a camera, your curiosity, and tons of enthusiasm. We’ll rally some experts and folks who specialize in deep urban ecology. Together we’ll make some great discoveries, have fun, and get to know these places and each other better.</p> <p>A bioblitz is an intensive one-day study of biodiversity in a specific location, bringing scientists and volunteer citizen-scientists together. Together we’ll look for sidewalk weeds, snails, flies, birds, mammals, butterflies and moths, other insects, spiders, trees, worms, flowers, and everything else we can find.</p> <p>People of all ages and skill levels are welcome! Bring your smart phone for sure. Bonus: camera, binoculars, and magnifying glasses. We’ll enter observations in iNaturalist and join together at the end to find out how many observations we made and how many species we found. Past blitzes in Oakland, San Francisco, and San Mateo have averaged 1000 observations and 200+ species each.</p> <p>Don't have an iNaturalist account yet? No problem! Download the iNaturalist app on iPhone, Android, sign up for an account, then make a few practice observations.</p> <p>Brought to you by Nature in the City, Studio for Urban Projects, Nerds for Nature, and iNaturalist.</p> <p>Registration:</p>",
