Feature: See who RSVPed for event

  As a user
  So that I can predict who's attending the event
  I want to be able to view who has RSVPed to the event

Background:

  And the following guests exist:

  And the following registrations exist:
  | event_id | guest_id |
  | 1        | 1        |
  | 1        | 2        |

Scenario: Guest sees all event attendees
  When I am on the "details" page for "Nature Walk"
  Then I should see attendees of "Nature Walk" listed alphabetically by last name
