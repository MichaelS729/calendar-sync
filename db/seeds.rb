# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:

User.create!(email: "amber@natureinthecity.org", password: "password", level: 0)
User.create!(email: "admin@admin.com", password: "password", level: 0)
User.create!(email: "vincehayashi@berkeley.edu", password: "password")
